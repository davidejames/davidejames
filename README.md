## Data/Software Engineer with a background in Electrical Engineering and Analytics

This profile is just getting started.

Most of my career work has been private, but includes topics such as:
- Custom OS for embedded applications
- Various machine Controls and Diagnostics
- Custom simulation platforms for NaMx and Li-ion battery systems
- SITL + HITL platforms for system development and testing
- End to end data and analytics pipelines
- Cloud-based analytics and microservices

What makes sense to put here? From now on, I plan on including anything I'm working on
for my personal use and projects I startup for learning purposes.
